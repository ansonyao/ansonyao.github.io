This page shows how to install Scrapy on a Redhat based linux system. I experienced some lib missing problem when installing on on an Redhat EC2 instance and
spend time to figure out. So I record it here if anyone else needs similar stuff.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo su
yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
yum install -y libffi-devel libxslt-devel libxml2-devel openssl-devel python-devel mysql-devel
{% endhighlight %}

The above commands prepared necessary environment to compile the project. Now we are ready to install Scrapy with 

{% highlight bash %}
pip install scrapy
{% endhighlight %}

This command will install the scrapy. Note that when it is successful, we still need to configure the path to make the scrapy command work.

{% highlight bash %}
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
{% endhighlight %}

Now we are ready to go. run scrapy!

{% highlight bash %}
scrapy crawl yourspider
{% endhighlight %}
